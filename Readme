Overview:
The goal of this code is to take an input file containing only sequences of A and B and write an output file that shows the score of tennis for this sequence. The character A denotes a point for player A and the character B denotes a point for player B. The sequence intitally describes the set score but when enough points have been won for a player then that player wins a game. The first player to win at least 6 games and have 2 clear games over the other player wins that match. The match score is saved and a new match is begun. The scores may flip as the scores will be shown as n-m where n is the server and m the receiver. Player A serves first. The output sequence is in the following format = [Previous Match Scores] [Current Match Score] [Current Set Score]. If there is no previous matches then it is ignored. The current match score is always shown even if it is 0-0. The current set score is shown only if it is not 0-0.
